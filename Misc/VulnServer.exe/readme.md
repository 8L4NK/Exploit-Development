*Vulnserver is a multithreaded Windows based TCP server that listens for client connections on port 9999 (by default) and allows the user to run a number of different commands that are vulnerable to various types of exploitable buffer overflows.*

*This software is intended mainly as a tool for learning how to find and exploit buffer overflow bugs, and each of the bugs it contains is subtly different from the others, requiring a slightly different approach to be taken when writing the exploit.*

*Though it does make an attempt to mimic a (simple) legitimate server program this software has no functional use beyond that of acting as an exploit target, and this software should not generally be run by anyone who is not using it as a learning tool.*
